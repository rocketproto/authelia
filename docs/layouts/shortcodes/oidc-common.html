### Common Notes

1. The [OpenID Connect 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) `client_id` parameter:
    1. This *__must__* be a unique value for every client.
    2. The value used in this guide is merely for readability and demonstration purposes and you should not use this
       value. We recommend 64 random characters but you can use any arbitrary value that meets the other criteria.
    3. This *__must__* only contain [RFC3986 Unreserved Characters](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.3).
    4. This *__must__* be no more than 100 characters in length.
2. The [OpenID Connect 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) `client_secret` parameter:
    1. The value used in this guide is merely for demonstration purposes and you *__should absolutely not__* use this in
       production and should instead utilize the
       [How Do I Generate Client Secrets]({{ $faq }}#how-do-i-generate-client-secrets) FAQ.
    2. This string may be stored as plaintext in the Authelia configuration but this behaviour is deprecated and is not
       guaranteed to be supported in the future. See the [Plaintext]({{ $faq }}#plaintext) guide for more
       information.
    3. When the secret is stored in hashed form in the authelia configuration (*__heavily recommended__*), the cost of hashing can, if too great,
       cause timeouts for clients. See the [Tuning the work factors]({{ $faq }}#tuning-work-factors) guide for more information.
3. The Configuration example for Authelia is only a portion of the required configuration and it should be used as a
   guide in conjunction with the standard
   [OpenID Connect 1.0 Provider Configuration]({{ printf "%s/provider.md" $config }}) and
   [OpenID Connect 1.0 Clients Configuration]({{ printf "%s/clients.md" $config }}) guides.
